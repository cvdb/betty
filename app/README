Check out of a selection of runners sorted by BSP which runners win most often.
For example out of an average of say 10, in most cases either runner 1 or 2 wins.

May provide the same info as average winning BSP percentage of 11;
Maybe the goal it to try find races where the BSP favorite is a CLEAR favorite...so worth betting on?
In cases where there are more than 1 runner under the 11% mark don't bet.
Does that EVER happen?
