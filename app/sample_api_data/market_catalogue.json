Betfair Non-Runner Rule applies. Reduction factors may be updated periodically at the discretion of Betfair based on trading in the market, but after approximately 5 minutes from scheduled ‘off’ time of a given race, they will be updated only in exceptional circumstances. Odds of matched bets will only be adjusted if there are ADDITIONAL non-runners after your bet is matched. This market will turn <b>IN PLAY</b> at the off with all unmatched bets cancelled once the Betfair SP reconciliation process has been completed. Betting will be suspended at the end of the race. This market will initially be settled on a First Past the Post basis. However we will re-settle all bets should the official result at the time of the \"weigh-in\" announcement differ from any initial settlement. Dead Heat rules apply.<br><br><b>BSP (Betfair Starting Price) operates on this market</b>.
